# tf2pulumi

`tf2pulumi` is deprecated and no longer maintained. The functionality is now
available from the Pulumi CLI's `pulumi convert --from terraform` command.
See [Migrating From Terraform to Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/adopting-pulumi/migrating-to-pulumi/from-terraform/)
for more information.
